The objective of this project is to develop a haptic feedback device to simulate the active whisking of a robotic rat. Previous works have demonstrated that rats can sense the environment from the bending of their whiskers. This project tries to explore this phenomenon by delivering such a sense of bending to humans haptically. The device includes six micro vibration motors in a group to represent the magnitude and direction of a signal. We use the Wi-Fi module of multiple micro-controllers to have a portable and accessible device.
